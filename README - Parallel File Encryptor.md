## Overview

This is a group project undertaken by the Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Chittagong, during the fifth semester. The project focuses on **Parallel File Encryption and Decryption** using Java.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java**: The project is entirely developed using Java. You will need a Java compiler and an IDE like **VS Code** or **Cursor** to run this project. No other programming languages are required.



## How to Run the Project

1. **Start the Program**:  
   To begin, navigate to the `MainMenu.java` file and run the program.

2. **Main Menu**:  
   Upon running the program, the main menu will appear with the following options:
   - **1. Encrypt**
   - **2. Decrypt**
   - **3. Exit**

3. **Encryption/Decryption Options**:  
   - If you select **Encrypt**, you'll be presented with options to encrypt:
     - Text
     - File
     - Image
     - Video
   - If you choose **Decrypt**, you'll have the corresponding options to decrypt the same types of files or content.

4. **File Selection**:  
   - You can select any file (text, image, video) from any location on your device to encrypt or decrypt.
   - After the encryption or decryption process is complete, the program will save the resulting file or content in the same folder as the original file.



## Features

- **Parallel Processing**: The project leverages parallel processing for faster encryption and decryption, ensuring efficiency even for larger files.
- **Support for Various File Types**: The tool supports text files, images, and videos, making it versatile and suitable for different types of content.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The user-friendly menu ensures ease of use and smooth interaction, even for those with minimal technical knowledge.
